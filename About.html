                                    All members should obtain a minimum of 25 points in the first semester through various service and social opportunities. Members do not meet this minimum by the deadline are put on probation or are dismissed from the club, according to the <a aria-label="Go to the policies section" href="#POLICIES">policies</a> laid out below.

                                    This semester, due to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, each current member must obtain only 18 points by the end of the first semester.

                                    The Key Club Board may institute a small point requirement over the summer. Failure to meet the requirement over the summer will result in any point deficit being added to the first semester. This year's summer point requirement is 5 points.

However, if a member fails to obtain the minimum amount of hours and is already on probation, that member will be dismissed from SPHS Key Club. Extra points gained in one year will roll over to the next.

                                    Members are put on probation because they did not meet the point requirement for a semester, but had a reasonable amount by the deadline. Members must make up their point deficit as well as fulfill the new requirement during the following period, otherwise they will be dismissed. Members put on probation during Semester 2 must make up their point deficit during the summer.

                                    Members that failed to obtain the minimum amount of points while on probation or had an amount considerably below the minimum points required will receive notification from the current Sergeant-at-Arms notifying them of their dismissal from Key. Dismissal from Key Club or any other service club denies students the chance to join another service club until the next year. Students must wait until the next application process to re-interview for another service club. Members that have been dismissed from and re-apply to Key will not be considered for membership.

                                    This semester, due to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, each current member must obtain 18 points by the end of the first semester.

                                    The Key Club Board may institute a small point requirement over the summer. Failure to meet the requirement over the summer will result in any point deficit being added to the first semester. This year's summer point requirement is 5 points.

However, if a member fails to obtain the minimum amount of hours and is already on probation, that member will be dismissed from SPHS Key Club.

                                <p>
                                    The original concept was to develop a vocational guidance program aimed to combat the problems of a student fraternity. The idea evolved into the formation of a youth service organization for the home, school and community.

                                <p>
                                    The first Key Club met at Sacramento High School in California in 1925. SPHS' Key Club was chartered May 13, 1941.
                                </p>
                                <h2>How did Key Club get its name?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    In 1925, California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent worked to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California. This club was comprised of the key boys in the school, willing to serve the school in any way possible and to create better school spirit. Thus, the club was dubbed Key Club.
                                </p>

                                    UNICEF (and the ELIMINATE project), March of Dimes, and Children’s Miracle Network are all service partners. Key Club members provide fundraising support for each of these groups.

                                <h2>How did Key Club get started?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    The original concept was to develop a vocational guidance program aimed to combat the problems of a student fraternity. The idea evolved into the formation of a youth service organization for the home, school and community.

                                <p>
                                    The first Key Club met at Sacramento High School in California in 1925. SPHS' Key Club was chartered May 13, 1941.

                                <h2>How did Key Club get its name?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    In 1925, California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent worked to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California. This club was comprised of the key boys in the school, willing to serve the school in any way possible and to create better school spirit. Thus, the club was dubbed Key Club.
