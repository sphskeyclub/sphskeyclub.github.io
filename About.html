                                    St. Petersburg High School has a joint application process for all service clubs in the beginning of the year. Beginning this year, all students, including freshmen, may apply.

                                    Applications are currently closed for the 2022-23 school year. For further inquiries, contact our sponsor, Mr. Benton, in room 1-223 or the Key Board email at <a href="mailto:sphskeyboard@gmail.com">sphskeyboard@gmail.com</a>.

                                    Following the conclusion of the application process, each service club at SPHS will invite members that applied to them to their auditions. During auditions, candidates for membership will be asked questions that vary by topic, specificity, and seriousness.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">
                                    All current members of Key Club are invited to attend auditions and pose questions for candidates to answer. Afterwards, candidates must wait for notification that their application and audition were accepted or rejected. A list of new members will be found on the gym doors.
                                </p>

                                    Unfortunately, neither Key Club nor any other service club at SPHS accepts new members during the course of the school year. Students seeking to join Key must wait until the beginning of the following year to participate in the annual service club application process.

                                    Applications are currently closed for the 2022-23 school year. For further inquiries, contact our sponsor, Mr. Benton, in room 1-223 or the Key Board email at <a href="mailto:sphskeyboard@gmail.com">sphskeyboard@gmail.com</a>.

                                <p>
                                    Following the conclusion of the application process, each service club at SPHS will invite members that applied to them to their auditions. During auditions, candidates for membership will be asked questions that vary by topic, specificity, and seriousness.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All current members of Key Club are invited to attend auditions and pose questions for candidates to answer. Afterwards, candidates must wait for notification that their application and audition were accepted or rejected. A list of new members will be found on the gym doors.
                                </p>
                                <h2>During the Year</h2>

                                    Unfortunately, neither Key Club nor any other service club at SPHS accepts new members during the course of the school year. Students seeking to join Key must wait until the beginning of the following year to participate in the annual service club application process.
                                </p>

                                    All members should obtain a minimum of 25 points in the first semester through various service and social opportunities. Members do not meet this minimum by the deadline are put on probation or are dismissed from the club, according to the <a href="#POLICIES">policies</a> laid out below. The deadline is announced on the SPHS Key Club Facebook page.

                                    Each member must have accumulated 50 points for the year by the end of the second semester.

                                    The Key Club Board may institute a small point requirement over the summer. Failure to meet the requirement over the summer will result in any point deficit being added to the first semester. This year's summer point requirement is 5 points.

However, if a member fails to obtain the minimum amount of hours and is already on probation, that member will be dismissed from SPHS Key Club. Extra points gained in one year will roll over to the next.

                                    Members are put on probation because they did not meet the point requirement for a semester, but had a reasonable amount by the deadline. Members must make up their point deficit as well as fulfill the new requirement during the following period, otherwise they will be dismissed. Members put on probation during Semester 2 must make up their point deficit during the summer.
                                </p>

                                    Members that failed to obtain the minimum amount of points while on probation or had an amount considerably below the minimum points required will receive notification from the current Sergeant-at-Arms notifying them of their dismissal from Key. Dismissal from Key Club or any other service club denies students the chance to join another service club until the next year. Students must wait until the next application process to re-interview for another service club. Members that have been dismissed from and re-apply to Key will not be considered for membership.

                                    Members are dismissed because of their lack of interest and involvement in the club. There are plenty of activities and service projects to participate in and it is the responsibility of each member to be active and passionate in service. <u>Key Club is a leadership and service club; it is not a title.</u> Key Club must make room for students who truly love service and want to be active.
