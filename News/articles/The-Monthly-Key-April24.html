                                have had a keytastic year of school and service so far! In April 2024, 
                                our club accumulated a total of <span class="articleImportant">431.5 service hours</span>! That's about 
                                18 days of service — if for each day of service we got one egg, we'd have 
                                about 2.571 pounds of egg (WOW)!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyways, in April 2024, our Key Club did a lot, so discover some of the things

                                DCON 2024 was a success! At DCON, SPHS' Key Club went to several workshops, 
                                ate a fancy dinner, and voted for the new district board (while having a lot of 
                                fun in-between). We already covered DCON 2024 in our article, "The Key Takeaways of 
                                DCON 2024," so if you want to learn more about the DCON experience,

                                Thank you to all the volunteers that helped with the DCON car wash, you were the reason 
                                our club was able to have enough funds for transportation and more!
                            </p>

                                In April, our school's Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society) hosted its annual 
                                Mighty Mu (Math Competition) for middle schoolers on April 6, 2024. Thanks to the help of 
                                11 Key volunteers with a total of 60 hours of service, the event was a success!
                            </p>

                                DCON 2024 was a success! At DCON, SPHS' Key Club went to several workshops, 
                                ate a fancy dinner, and voted for the new district board (while having a lot of 
                                fun in-between). We already covered DCON 2024 in our article, "The Key Takeaways of 
                                DCON 2024," so if you want to learn more about the DCON experience,

                                Thank you to all the volunteers that helped with the DCON car wash, you were the reason 
                                our club was able to have enough funds for transportation and more!

                                In April, our school's Mu Alpha Theta (Math Honor Society) hosted its annual

                                11 Key volunteers with a total of 60 hours of service, the event was a success!
