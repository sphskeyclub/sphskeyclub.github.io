                                Zachary Ratkiewicz — Bonjour Keyples!! You may have wondered what were the results of each meeting's "ethical" question, which I make everyone at the meeting do (MWAHAHA)! Well today, you're in luck!
                            </p>   
                            <h2>December 13th Meeting</h2>
                            <p class="quote">
                                "If one healthy person's organs could save five lives, is it ethical to sacrifice them?" <span style="font-style: normal;">(Created by Zachary Ratkiewicz!)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ummm so this one is kind of dark and scary... whoops! However, despite its darkness, <span class="articleImportant">42 of you (56%)</span> said it IS ethical to sacrifice one person to save five lives. I sure hope none of you guys will be my doctor holy cow.
                            </p>
                            <h2>January 31st Meeting</h2>
                            <p class="quote">
                                "Is it ethical to repurpose dead bodies in a facility for conservation purposes (fertilizer, saving graveyard space, etc.) if they didn't give consent?" <span style="font-style: normal;">(Created by Brody Whiteside!)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, for the last question, most of you said it's okay to sacrifice someone — but for this one, only <span class="articleImportant">26 of you (36.1%)</span> said it's ethical to repurpose dead bodies in a facility for conservation?? I mean I guess the last one didn't say if it was <i>ethical</i> or not... sorry for these emo questions (this is only a glimpse into my dark and twisted world)!!
                            </p>
                            <h2>February 21st Meeting</h2>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This one scares me highkey. Anyways, <span class="articleImportant">38 of our wonderful Keyple friends (66.7%)</span> said that they'd rather LOSE THEIR MEMORIES, instead of having everyone else lose their memories of them. For this one, I agree: I'd probably receive my IB diploma without taking any exams (out of pity). SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL!!! Who's going into a 2 month coma with me!?

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This one's probably the most realistic and actually "ethical" question we've asked... probably because this question was created by Mrs. Hack! Anyways, an overwhelming <span class="articleImportant">48 of you (94.1%)</span> said that it IS ethical for students to receive additional benefits! INTERESTING!
                            </p>

                                Finally, our last question. AND THE MOST ETHICAL OF ALL: what cool thing would you like potentially an infinite amount of!? This one was just for funsies: it was a short response and you (yes YOU!) HAD to answer. Let's see what some of yall came up with...

                                Zachary Ratkiewicz — Bonjour Keyples!! You may have wondered what were the results of each meeting's "ethical" question, which I make everyone at the meeting do (MWAHAHA)! Well today, you're in luck!
                            </p>   
                            <h2>December 13th Meeting</h2>
                            <p class="quote">

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ummm so this one is kind of dark and scary... whoops! However, despite its darkness, <span class="articleImportant">42 of you (56%)</span> said it IS ethical to sacrifice one person to save five lives. I sure hope none of you guys will be my doctor holy cow.
                            </p>
                            <h2>January 31st Meeting</h2>
                            <p class="quote">

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, for the last question, most of you said it's okay to sacrifice someone — but for this one, only <span class="articleImportant">26 of you (36.1%)</span> said it's ethical to repurpose dead bodies in a facility for conservation?? I mean I guess the last one didn't say if it was <i>ethical</i> or not... sorry for these emo questions (this is only a glimpse into my dark and twisted world)!!
                            </p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This one scares me highkey. Anyways, <span class="articleImportant">38 of our wonderful Keyple friends (66.7%)</span> said that they'd rather LOSE THEIR MEMORIES, instead of having everyone else lose their memories of them. For this one, I agree: I'd probably receive my IB diploma without taking any exams (out of pity). SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL!!! Who's going into a 2 month coma with me!?

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This one's probably the most realistic and actually "ethical" question we've asked... probably because this question was created by Mrs. Hack! Anyways, an overwhelming <span class="articleImportant">48 of you (94.1%)</span> said that it IS ethical for students to receive additional benefits! INTERESTING!
