                                Zachary Ratkiewicz (Webmaster) â€” Hi everyone, I hope you all 
                                have had a keytastic first semester of school and service so far! Get ready for some crazy totals... 
                                as of December 18th, 2024, our club has accumulated a total of <span class="articleImportant">1365 hours</span> in just Semester 1! That's 
                                <span class="articleImportant">56.875 days</span> of service and fun activities... WOWZERS, flipping BONKERS!!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                See how we got to this crazy total in the different club activities we did this semester...
                            </p>

                            <h2>Interviews, "Rushing", and Inductions</h2>
                            <p>
                                After Interviews and "Rushing", we gained <span class="articleImportant">63 new members</span>, increasing our 
                                membership by <span class="articleImportant">107%</span>! Thank you so much for joining Key (you're obviously 
                                goated)!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On November 15th, we had Inductions, where we introduced our new members to the club! Our theme 
                                for this year's Inductions was <span class="articleImportant">'A Night At The Key Museum'</span>, where paintings came to life and stole Mr. Benton's 
                                amazing portrait (made by Alison Ashley, the Creative Committee Chair). The thief? Don't be fooled, 
                                it was a group effort: <span class="articleImportant">A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (Lily Cuddy) and The Swing (Joy Santiago) stole it</span>! Thanks for coming to Inductions and 
                                see you next year!!
                            </p>
                            <h2>Blood Drive</h2>
                            <p>
                                For the Key Blood Drive, we didn't let the hurricanes affect us! On December 5th at the Key Blood Drive, <span class="articleImportant">we were able to 
                                gather the highest amount of donations in over 4 years</span>!

                                This semester, Key Club participated in Gulfport's 2024 Gecko Fest! We set up the 'Kid's Craft Corner' with 
                                Gulfport Kiwanis, and it was flipping fire if I do say so myself. At this event, we accumulated a total of 
                                <span class="articleImportant">23.5 service hours</span>!!

                            <p>
                                At December DCM, we created amazing chalk art with our own hands! We also had cookies and discussed divisional 
                                and district updates! We had frosted sugar cookies â€” and they were goated. Come to the next one unless you're an opp!!
                            </p>
                            <h2>KCKC (Key Club Kickoff Conference)</h2>
                            <p>
                                At KCKC, we did officer trainings and networked with other Key Clubbers across Zones E-M! The KCKC theme was 'Saddle Up For Service', so 
                                of course we had to dress up like the wild west (meow). Come to the next KCKC if you want to learn more about the Florida District 
                                and Key Club International!

                                On August 11th, we had a grand 'ol time helping St. Petersburg Kiwanis with the Mad Hatter's Tea Party! 
                                There, we blew up balloons, created a balloon arch, face painted, tattooed, made crafts, and danced! 
                                See the mighty, mighty balloon arch we created (below)!

                                Zachary Ratkiewicz (Webmaster) â€” Hi everyone, I hope you all 
                                have had a keytastic first semester of school and service so far! Get ready for some crazy totals... 
                                as of December 18th, 2024, our club has accumulated a total of <span class="articleImportant">1365 hours</span> in just Semester 1! That's 
                                <span class="articleImportant">56.875 days</span> of service and fun activities... WOWZERS, flipping BONKERS!!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                See how we got to this crazy total in the different club activities we did this semester...
                            </p>

                            <h2>Interviews, "Rushing", and Inductions</h2>
                            <p>
                                After Interviews and "Rushing", we gained <span class="articleImportant">63 new members</span>, increasing our 
                                membership by <span class="articleImportant">107%</span>! Thank you so much for joining Key (you're obviously 
                                goated)!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On November 15th, we had Inductions, where we introduced our new members to the club! Our theme 
                                for this year's Inductions was <span class="articleImportant">'A Night At The Key Museum'</span>, where paintings came to life and stole Mr. Benton's 
                                amazing portrait (made by Alison Ashley, the Creative Committee Chair). The thief? Don't be fooled, 
                                it was a group effort: <span class="articleImportant">A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (Lily Cuddy) and The Swing (Joy Santiago) stole it</span>! Thanks for coming to Inductions and 
                                see you next year!!
                            </p>

                                For the Key Blood Drive, we didn't let the hurricanes affect us! On December 5th at the Key Blood Drive, <span class="articleImportant">we were able to 
                                gather the highest amount of donations in over 4 years</span>!

                                At December DCM, we created amazing chalk art with our own hands! We also had cookies and discussed divisional 
                                and district updates! We had frosted sugar cookies â€” and they were goated. Come to the next one unless you're an opp!!

                                At KCKC, we did officer trainings and networked with other Key Clubbers across Zones E-M! The KCKC theme was 'Saddle Up For Service', so 
                                of course we had to dress up like the wild west (meow). Come to the next KCKC if you want to learn more about the Florida District
