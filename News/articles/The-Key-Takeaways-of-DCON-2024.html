                                This workshop will be presented by Ryann Daniel from Bozeman HS."

                                Zumba through Service (Ishitha Panguluri) — "Zumba is an interval-style dance fitness party that combines low-intensity 
                                and high-intensity moves. You'll burn lots of calories as you move to the rhythm with Latin-inspired dance moves. The best part 
                                of it all is that it doesn't even feel like exercise! Come join Governor Ishi as she puts her Zumba skills to the test!"
                            </p>
